# Kolkata EV and Solar Integration Prototype Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating a Minetest prototype that simulates the deployment of high-capacity electric vehicles and advanced solar panel technologies in Kolkata's transportation system.

## Key Areas to Model

### 1. Park Street
- Commercial hub with high traffic density
- Features:
  - EV bus stations with solar-powered charging points
  - Solar panels on commercial building rooftops
  - Dedicated EV lanes
  - Air quality monitoring stations

### 2. Victoria Memorial
- Historical landmark and tourist attraction
- Features:
  - Solar-powered tourist EVs
  - Solar panels integrated with heritage-sensitive design
  - EV charging stations in parking areas
  - Green buffer zones with air purifying plants

### 3. Alipore Zoo
- Popular recreational area
- Features:
  - Solar-powered zoo transport
  - Educational displays about EV and solar technology
  - Solar panels on administrative buildings
  - Zero-emission zones

### 4. Transportation Network
- Connecting the key areas
- Features:
  - High-capacity electric bus routes
  - Electric tram lines (utilizing existing infrastructure)
  - EV charging hubs at major intersections
  - Solar-powered street lighting

## Technical Implementation

### Building Structures
- Use WorldEdit mod for efficient creation of buildings and infrastructure
- Create templates for:
  - Residential buildings with rooftop solar
  - Commercial buildings with integrated solar facades
  - EV charging stations
  - Bus stops and transport hubs

### Transportation Systems
- Implement:
  - Electric bus network with designated routes
  - Electric tram system
  - EV charging infrastructure
  - Traffic management systems

### Solar Integration
- Model:
  - Rooftop solar arrays on buildings
  - Solar canopies over parking areas
  - Solar-powered street lighting
  - Solar farms in peripheral areas

### Educational Elements
- Include:
  - Information boards explaining technologies
  - Before/after pollution level displays
  - Cost-benefit analysis displays
  - Interactive elements demonstrating solar power generation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Base Map Creation
